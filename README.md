# QRCodeGenerator
This code generates a QR code that links to my GitHub profile using the qrcode and PIL (Python Imaging Library) libraries.


The QR code is created with specified version, error correction, box size, and border. Then, the code generates the image of the QR code with the fill color set to purple and the background color set to black. Finally, the image is saved in the img folder inside the QRCodeGenerator directory. The absolute path to the img folder is constructed using the os.path module, and the image is saved with a file name.
